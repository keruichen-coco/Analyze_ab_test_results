# Analyze_ab_test_results

This project is for Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree program. It aims to show the coding ability of probability, A/B test, and regression models.

## Goal 
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
